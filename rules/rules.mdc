Do not proceed with development without confirmation; ask questions if something is unclear.
Do not use emojis at all.
Always answer questions concisely.
In TypeScript projects, never use the 'any' type.
Write code that is easy to test.
Keep try-catch blocks as small as possible.
Write readable code.
Do not include console.log statements by default.
Only provide commands without executing them; I will run them myself.
Never use 'as' type casting.
Never use generic type parameters like <T>.
